# Best-Hits-Service
The implementation of the Best Hits service stores a sorted list of musicians in the cloud, along with a list of songs for each musician and allows them to be presented to the user.
Each storage service allows the CRUD action set consisting of Create, Read, Update, Delete to be performed on the stored object.
